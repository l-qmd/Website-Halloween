<p>The main goal of this project is to develop my skills in web languages, with a particular focus on responsiveness. The chosen theme for the website is Halloween, a very popular holiday.<br> My objective is to create a complete website, from A to Z, before October 31st, to present the history of this holiday and showcase the different traditions and ways of celebrating it. <br>I plan to include detailed information about the origins of Halloween, associated symbols, as well as ideas for costumes and decorations to inspire visitors. <br>Additionally, I intend to highlight traditional recipes from this period, fun games, and activities for the whole family. In summary, my aim is to create a comprehensive and entertaining website, providing an immersive and educational experience on the theme of Halloween.</p>
