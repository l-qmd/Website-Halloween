<p>The main goal of this project is to develop my skills in web languages, with a particular focus on responsiveness. The chosen theme for the website is Halloween, a very popular holiday.<br> My objective is to create a complete website, from A to Z, before October 31st, to present the history of this holiday and showcase the different traditions and ways of celebrating it. <br>I plan to include detailed information about the origins of Halloween, associated symbols, as well as ideas for costumes and decorations to inspire visitors. <br>Additionally, I intend to highlight traditional recipes from this period, fun games, and activities for the whole family. In summary, my aim is to create a comprehensive and entertaining website, providing an immersive and educational experience on the theme of Halloween.</p>
<h2>üé® The web mock-up</h2>
The fundamental aim of the web mock-up is to visualise the project in its entirety in order to save time later on and simplify tasks.<br> The plan is to produce this mock-up on the Figma platform, allowing everyone to take a close look and share their comments and suggestions. <br>This crucial step will ensure a better understanding of the project and guarantee effective collaboration throughout the development process.<br>

<h2>üîçTo conclude</h2>
<p>
  I encountered a few difficulties, particularly during the IT development, but I was able to learn some valuable lessons during the course of this project. During this experience, I had the opportunity to learn how to create a counter using JavaScript, how to manage my time efficiently and how to complete a project satisfactorily.<br> These new skills will enable me to tackle future projects with greater confidence.
